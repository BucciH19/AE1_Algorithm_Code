# AE1_Algorithm_Code
In this repository you can find the Iris dataset csv file and the CICIDS2017 datset csvs that were used in each algorithm.
You can also find all of the Python code that was produced in my COM616_AE1 dissertation project, including:
- Iris dataset test algorithms
- Pre-processing script built into CICIDS2017 dataset algorithms
- CICIDS2017 dataset algorithms
