# AE1_Algorithm_Code
In this repository you can find all of the Python code that was produced in my COM616_AE1 dissertation project, including:
- Iris dataset test algorithms
- Pre-processing script built into CICIDS2017 dataset algorithms
- CICIDS2017 dataset algorithms

Unfortunately the Iris dataset csv file and the CICIDS2017 datset csvs that were used in each algorithm were too large so could not be uploaded, these were:
- iris.csv
- Friday-WorkingHours-Morning.pcap_ISCX (cicids2017_botnet)
- Friday-WorkingHours-Afternoon-DDos.pcap_ISCX (cicids2017_ddos)
- Friday-WorkingHours-Afternoon-PortScan.pcap_ISCX (cicids2017_portscan)

You can download the Iris dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris
You can download the CICIDS2017 dataset and relevant files from the University of New Brunswick's Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity: https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html
